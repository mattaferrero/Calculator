// Preface
This file describes the basic algorithm used to create and populate
the Abstract Syntax Tree for use in basic arithmetic calculations.
Although an effort has been made to ensure the tree can be populated
with tokens of any variety, this current program version only
guarantees arithmetic operations be calculated accurately to a
precision of n digits. These operations are:

Parentheticals, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Currently represented with the ASCII characters:

( ) ^ * / + -

Which are the basic arithmetic operations typically taught in early
formal education. Although regional variations exist even within
fundamental mathematics, it is assumed other institutions across the
globe are not as pathetically idiotic as my own. Therefore, it is the
desperately sincere hope of this author that everyone on the fucking
planet can agree what basic arithmetic operations are and the other
in which they should be handled.
